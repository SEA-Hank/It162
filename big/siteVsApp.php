            <h1>What is Responsive Websites, Web Apps and Native apps</h1>
            <h4>Responsive Websites</h4>
            <p>Responsive websites are designed to work on any platform as it is a custom CSS stylesheet that makes the website look great on any device. So, whether you’re accessing it from your PC, iPhone, Android or tablet, the your website will format perfectly.</p>
            <h4>Web Apps</h4>
            <p>Web apps are often confused with mobile apps, and with the advent of HTML5, the lines are becoming even blurrier. Web apps look and feel very much like mobile apps – they even store data in your browser’s cache, so much of the app can be accessed offline.
            </p>
            <h4>Mobile Apps</h4>
            <p>You know when you go to the App Store or to Google Play and download an app? Yeah, those are mobile apps. You’ll notice that they are usually designed for a very specific and narrow purpose. One may be a game. Another may help you with your banking. You may even download an app to help you find the best vegetarian restaurants in any city. They are usually designed to be helpful and interactive. They often allow some sort of purchase to be made within the app (score for you, the business owner).
