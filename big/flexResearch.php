            <p>The Flexible Box Module, usually referred to as flexbox, was designed as a one-dimensional layout model, and as a method that could offer space distribution between items in an interface and powerful alignment capabilities.

This can be contrasted with the two-dimensional model of CSS Grid Layout, which controls columns and rows together.</p>
