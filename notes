sudo apachectl start

sudo apachectl restart

sudo apachectl stop

/etc/apache2/httpd.conf

 DirectoryIndex index.html index.php

 if i don't want to change the User and Group. put the webroot in /User/hank/myfolder  not /User/Hank/desktop/xxxxx
                                                                                           desktop is created by system.
###### it doesn't work now !!!

since update OS, the website folder can NOT in the desktop folder !!! I don't know why, 
but put the website folder in the User root folder is fine or other folders also fine
